```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)
Sys.setlocale('LC_CTYPE', 'Chinese')
```

We collect several ways to get the 2019-nCoV epidemic data.

## Use the R ncovr package

R users can get the epidemic data via the ncovr package, which basically includes the datasets described later.

```r
install.packages('remotes') # Install the remotes package
remotes::install_github('pzhaonet/ncovr') # Install the ncovr package
Sys.setlocale('LC_CTYPE', 'Chinese') # windows users have to set the Chinese environment
require("ncovr") # Load the ncovr package
get_ncov() # read RDS data (defaultï¼›recommended)
get_ncov(method = 'csv') # read .csv files (recommended)
get_ncov(method = 'api') # read from api
```

Please see the help documents for more details.

## Download directly

Non-R users can download the .csv files directly from the repository [BlankerL/DXY-2019-nCoV-Data](https://github.com/BlankerL/DXY-2019-nCoV-Data), and then open it with tools such as Excel.

This repository provides .json files as well.

An Excel spreadsheet of daily national data can be [downloaded](https://github.com/JackieZheng/2019-nCoV/raw/master/Excel/data.xlsx) from the [JackieZheng/2019-nCoV](https://github.com/JackieZheng/2019-nCoV/). This project also provides other data format with the same content.

It would be appreciated if you let us know other data sources, which will be listed here.


## Introduction to R

R is a free and open-source software package. We use R for data collection, cleaning, and visualization, as well as developing models, building this website, and automatically updating.

For R beginners, we published a book *Learning R: from the very beginning* (Peng Zhao and Yi Li. Research Press,2018. In Chinese). Click the following image and visit the homepage and read sample chapters for free.
